# Introduction

Welcome to the CBIS REST API Reference.
If you don't have an API key, visit <a href='http://help.citybreak.com/'>Citybreak Support</a> to get one.

The API is divided into 2 parts, **Raw** and **Localized**. The first one is designed to get all the data we have about something, when the second one is designed to print data in real time.

This documentation is too long? Go play right now with the <a href="https://cbis-rest-api.citybreak.com/v1/swagger/ui/index">Swagger UI</a> and come back later.
